## Introduction
This document provides guidelines for developers contributing to the Python application. It includes setup instructions, project structure, and best practices.

## Project Structure
```
src/
├── environment/           # Core application logic
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
└── main.py        # Entry point of the application
```

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
4. (Optional) Activate the virtual environment:
    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      venv\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
5. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install .
    ```

## Development Workflow
- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
  ```
- Commit changes with meaningful messages:
  ```bash
  git commit -m "Add feature description"
  ```
- Push changes and create a pull request.

## Testing (Not Implemented Yet)
Run tests using:
```bash
pytest
```
Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Contributing
- Follow the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Adhere to the project's coding standards.
- Submit detailed pull requests with clear descriptions.
- Write tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Update documentation as needed.
